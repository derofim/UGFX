# This file contains rules that control how Git handles binary and text files, including line endings
#

# Make sure Windows batch files preserve CR/LF line endings, otherwise they may not be able to execute.  Windows
# batch files require a CR/LF for labels to work properly, otherwise they may fail when labels straddle 512-byte
# block boundaries.  This is important when files are downloaded through a zip archive that was authored on a
# Linux machine (the default behavior on GitHub)

*.bat eol=crlf

# Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout.
*.cpp text eol=crlf
*.h text eol=crlf
*.css text eol=crlf
*.html text eol=crlf
*.js text eol=crlf
